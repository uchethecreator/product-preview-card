## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS positions
- CSS media queries

### What I learned

I learnt how to make pages responsive using the CSS media query

```css
@media screen and (max-width:800px){}
```
the code above simply means to aplly certain css styles to devices with 800px screen and below. Such devices include phones, tablets or an ipad.



### Useful resources

- [Tutorial for media queries](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - This helped me understand the concept of max-width and min-width, and how it works in media queries.
